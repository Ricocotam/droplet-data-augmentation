# What are droplets augmentation ?
Droplets augmentation come from an idea of @VieVie31 and @Ricocotam for data augmentation. We both wanted a new funny way to get more data so we found this. Drop some transformations on your image (for now we only thought about images). We've seen as droping water droplet on an actual picture and seeing some zoom or distortion.

# How to use ?
You simply follow the documentation for the parameters. Implemented dropelets use scipy.ndimage transformations so if you want more information on the actual transformation, you might look at scipy.ndimage documentation.
